   "This sounds pitchy but I never thought it possible that I would give any contractor 5 stars let alone write a positive review but they earned it! I've done three large residential projects before with different contractors and encountered every negative cliche with 3 different contractors. Fourth time was the charm from start to finish Kris was easy to deal with, honest and straight-forward, timely and considerate. / Douglas W.", 
   "We are very happy with the work that Kris and his team did for us on our kitchen/bath renovation. Kris was great at helping us think through the details of our project, giving us options when decisions had to be made, and helping us understand the implications of those decisions. This team is composed of master craftspeople who do very high-quality and precise work. / Jim F.",
   "I would definitely recommend Kris and his team again for any renovation! I had a kitchen completely done and they did a fantastic job. Kris made sure to keep me up to date with the progress of the job and of any delays or changes. I love my new kitchen and Kris and his team delivered on a modern, quality product! / Thomas H.",
   "It was our first ever experience renovating and Kris was helpful and communicative throughout the entire process.

   "Kris’s experience in this kind of work was invaluable throughout the process, and when minor hiccups occurred – as they invariably do in these types of projects – his creativity and expertise always led to innovative solutions. The end result is a really fantastic change from the original apartment. / Steven T.", 
   "I have dealt with many different contractors over the years, and I can say without reservation that Kris has been my favorite by far. From the very beginning Kris and his entire team demonstrated a level of professionalism I had not encountered before. Both in the field and in the office, this team exemplifies how things ought to be. / Frans P.",
   "Kris's ability to stick to the schedule is impressive. He often puts forth a schedule that it faster than most and is able to meet the deadlines. His millwork fabricator (kitchen cabinets) does a very nice job and I strongly recommend him for all types of cabinets. They did a wonderful job with all of our over size cabinet and closet doors. / Casey A.",
   "Kris did such a good job on my kitchen, that I used him again for my son's kitchen. They are professional, honest, reasonably priced, and easy to work with.

   "Kris Famurat and his company are devoted to the quality of their work and to the satisfaction of his clients. In a world where it's hard to know whether you can trust any given contractor or rely on the quality of the work, Kris earns an A+ for trust, quality and professionalism. / Joel D.", 
   "Fantastic! I started looking for someone to install sliding doors and new kitchen cabinet doors and ended up using Kris Famurat for my apartment renovation.

I highly recommend Famurat Builders! / Camilo D."]
